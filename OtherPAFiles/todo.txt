To-Do for Pixel Array
MUST:
- "Improve the scalability of our implementation of the Pixel Array method"
- "Validate and test our Pixel Array code so that it can be made publicly available"
NEW FEATURES:
- Make it possible to translate problems from arbitrary networks to Pixel Array format
    - Probably making use of MetaGraphs.jl
    - Need some way to specify equations at each node in a generic form
- Automatic TikZification or plotting of wiring diagrams
- Work with arbitrary semirings? (if we see a good reason to)
EFFICIENCY:
- Implement Dijkstra-like (or A*) algorithm to find efficient clusterings
    - Nodes = sequences of merges, edges = adding a merge to the end of a sequence
    - Cost = time complexity added when traveling along an edge
    - Heuristic for A*: time complexity of finishing the multiplication right there?
- Look into how we’re clustering trees: is there a better way? What’s the optimal head choice?
- Exploit sparsity
CLEANUP:
- Find some way to have the same variable in two ports for the same pack
    - Current implementation assumes this is not the case
    - Might have to change interaction with objects more than objects themselves
- Maybe change “Port” to “Variable” or something, since we’re treating them as if they’re shared between packs (i.e. more as variables than as ports)
- Make dynamic plotting smarter / easier to use
