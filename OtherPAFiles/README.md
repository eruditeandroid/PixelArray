Core modules, tests, demos, and future plans for an implementation of the Pixel Array method: see https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00061

The "experimental" folder includes code that may be useful in future but is either unfinished, unpolished, or not useful right now.

The file format for storing networks is loosely based on that of MATPOWER: see http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/

References to "Kundur 1994" in the code are to the book "Power System Stability and Control"
